THE STEPS THAT I HAVE USED TO INSTALL SASS ARE AS FOLLOWS

 1. Install Node.js and npm
SASS requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

- Download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

 2.Install SASS via npm
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
npm install -g sass
```
The `-g` flag installs SASS globally, making it accessible from any directory.

 3. Verify SASS installation
Check if SASS is installed correctly:
bash
sass --version
```
This should display the installed version of SASS.

 4. Using SASS
To compile a `.scss` file:
```bash
sass input.scss output.css
```
Or watch a directory for changes:
```bash
sass --watch input.scss:output.css
```
